# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Capstone
This is skin lesion detection web app project collaborated with Hershey Medical Center.

It utilizes various techniques and machine learning models to implement the Progressive Web Application(PWA) which detect skin lesion and classify the disease types.  

Dataset 

ISIC 2018: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018 

The HAM10000 dataset is included in ISIC 2018 and is also a part of the ISIC 2019 dataset. 

A portion of this dataset was manually labeled using Roboflow. 

This manually labeled data was employed to train a model capable of automatic and comprehensive self-labeling. 

The trained model was subsequently utilized to assist in instance segmentation within the combined dataset. 

Combined Dataset: only training proportion of each was used (50000+)
